HARNESS.IO
Software Engineer Intern
July 2023 - January 2024 | Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
1. Played a pivotal role in developing the Harness NextGen Custom
   Approval feature, utilized by 90% of Harness customers. Focused
   on test plan creation, execution, and automation for critical test
   cases, significantly enhancing software reliability.
2. Contributed actively to comprehensive feature release validations
   in Harness NextGen, participating in bug fixes and fulfilling
   on-call responsibilities. Successfully increased code coverage for
   multiple features from60%to90%,improving overall robustness
   and reliability. Additionally, overhauled Harness documentation
   and authored knowledge-based articles for inclusion in the
   Harness Developers hub, fostering user understanding and
   community engagement.



a. The system developed during the internship focused on enhancing the functionality and reliability of the Harness platform, specifically in two key areas:
   -> Harness NextGen Custom Approval feature: This feature allowed users to create, execute, and automate critical test cases, thereby improving software reliability. It played a pivotal role in the approval process for software releases within the Harness platform.
   -> Comprehensive feature release validations: This involved actively participating in bug fixes and increasing code coverage for multiple features in Harness NextGen. The aim was to enhance the overall robustness and reliability of the platform.

b. Similar systems to those developed at Harness.io might include:
   -> Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) platforms with features for test case management, execution, and automation.
   -> Software testing and quality assurance tools that focus on improving software reliability and robustness through comprehensive testing and validation processes.

c. In approaching the development problem, I likely followed a structured approach that involved:
   -> Understanding the requirements and objectives of the features being developed.
   -> Collaborating with team members to design and implement solutions that address the identified needs.
   -> Utilizing best practices in software engineering, such as test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration, to ensure high-quality code and reliable software.
   -> Actively participating in the testing and validation processes to identify and fix bugs and enhance the overall stability of the platform.
   -> Engaging with documentation and knowledge-sharing initiatives to improve user understanding and community engagement with the platform.

d. Interesting aspects where code from Stack Overflow might have been used could include:
   -> Implementing specific functionalities or features that required complex logic or integration with external systems.
   -> Addressing challenges related to optimizing code performance or improving scalability.
   -> Integrating with third-party libraries or services to enhance the capabilities of the Harness platform.

e. Some specific learning experiences from copying code from Stack Overflow might include:
   -> Understanding different programming techniques and approaches to solving common development challenges.
   -> Learning about potential pitfalls and edge cases that need to be considered when implementing certain functionalities.
   -> Gaining insights into best practices for code organization, readability, and maintainability, which contribute to the overall quality of the software being developed.
